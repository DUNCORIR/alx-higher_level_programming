1. What is Database & SQL?
Databases: Organized collections of data stored electronically. They enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information.
SQL (Structured Query Language): A standard language for interacting with databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations) in a database.
Key takeaways:

Databases store data in tables (rows and columns).
SQL commands interact with these tables using statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
2. A Basic MySQL Tutorial
Covers the essentials of using MySQL, a popular open-source database management system.
Topics include:
Creating and managing databases.
Basic SQL syntax, including creating tables and inserting data.
Using queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
Key takeaways:

Focus on SQL syntax, MySQL-specific features, and database interaction through the MySQL client.
3. Basic SQL Statements: DDL and DML
DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to define and modify database structure.
Common statements: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to manipulate data within the database.
Common statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Key takeaways:

Understand the purpose of each statement.
Example:
sql
CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice');
4. Basic Queries: SQL and RA
SQL queries retrieve data from a database using commands like:
SELECT (retrieve specific columns).
WHERE (filter data).
JOIN (combine rows from different tables).
RA (Relational Algebra): The theoretical foundation of SQL, used to express queries in mathematical terms.
Key takeaways:

Learn to translate practical SQL queries into relational algebra concepts for deeper understanding.
5. SQL Technique: Functions
Functions enhance SQL capabilities by performing operations on data.
Common categories:
Aggregate Functions: Work on multiple rows, e.g., SUM(), AVG(), COUNT().
String Functions: Manipulate strings, e.g., CONCAT(), SUBSTR().
Date Functions: Handle date/time, e.g., NOW(), DATE_ADD().
Key takeaways:

Use functions to simplify and optimize queries.
Example:
sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
6. SQL Technique: Subqueries
A subquery is a query within another query.
Types:
Single-row subqueries: Return one value.
Multi-row subqueries: Return a list of values.
Correlated subqueries: Use values from the outer query.
Key takeaways:

Subqueries provide modular and reusable query logic.
Example:
sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
7. What Makes the Big Difference Between a Backtick and an Apostrophe?
Backticks: Used to enclose database object names (e.g., tables, columns) that may conflict with SQL keywords or contain special characters.
Example
sql
SELECT `select` FROM `my-table`;
Apostrophes (Single Quotes): Enclose string literals.
Example:
sql
SELECT 'Hello World' AS message;
Key takeaway:

Use backticks for database identifiers and single quotes for string literals to avoid syntax errors.
