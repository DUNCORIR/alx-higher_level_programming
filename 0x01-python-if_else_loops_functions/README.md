0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

Python provides several control flow tools to manage the execution of code blocks
if, elif, else: These are the main tools for branching logic based on conditions.
for and while loops: These loops allow you to iterate over sequences (like lists, strings) or repeat code while a condition is true.
break, continue, else in loops:

break: Exits the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.
else: Executes after a loop completes normally, without hitting break.
IndentationError
Python uses indentation (whitespace at the beginning of lines) to denote blocks of code. Consistency in using tabs or spaces is crucial.
IndentationError occurs when the code isn't indented properly, or mixing tabs and spaces happens.

How To Use String Formatters in Python 3
Python has powerful string formatting options:

f-strings (formatted string literals) introduced in Python 3.6, which allow embedding expressions inside string literals.

Learn to Program
Python offers a gentle learning curve for beginners with a simple, readable syntax.
The focus in early programming with Python is on:
Variables: Store values for use later in the code.
Control flow tools: Make decisions (if statements) and repeat code (loops).
Basic functions: Allow you to encapsulate reusable code.

Pycodestyle â€“ Style Guide for Python Code
Python has an official style guide called PEP 8, which provides conventions for writing readable, consistent Python code.
pycodestyle is a tool used to check Python code against the style guidelines.
Important style rules from PEP 8:
Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.
Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
Use a space after # for inline comments.
