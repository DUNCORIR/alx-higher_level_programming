0. Unit Testing and How to Implement it in a Large Project.

Unit Testing:

Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a program are tested independently to ensure that they work as expected. A "unit" can be a function, method, or class. The purpose is to verify that each unit performs as intended.
In Python, the unittest module is the built-in framework for writing unit tests. It allows developers to write test cases, create test suites, and run tests to validate that code behaves correctly.
Implementing Unit Testing in Large Projects:

Large projects usually have many interconnected modules, so unit testing helps ensure that changes in one part of the code do not break functionality elsewhere.
Break down the project into smaller units or modules and write tests for each function/class.
Use test-driven development (TDD), where you write the tests before writing the actual code. This ensures that each part of the code is verified.
Create test suites to organize related tests together, making it easier to run specific tests or groups of tests.
Continuous integration (CI) tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions can automate running unit tests whenever code changes.

1. How to Serialize and Deserialize a Class
Serialization:
Serialization is the process of converting a Python object (like a dictionary, list, or class instance) into a format that can be stored or transmitted (like a JSON string, binary format, or XML). This makes it possible to save an object's state or send it over a network.
Example: Using the json.dumps() method to serialize a Python dictionary into a JSON string.
Deserialization:
Deserialization is the reverse process of converting a serialized format back into a Python object.
Example: Using json.loads() to convert a JSON string back into a Python dictionary.
Serializing and Deserializing a Class:
Pythonâ€™s json module does not natively handle custom classes, but you can use the __dict__ attribute to convert an object's attributes into a dictionary for serialization.
Alternatively, you can implement custom default() and object_hook methods to handle more complex cases of class serialization/deserialization.

2. Write and Read a JSON File
Writing a JSON File:

Use json.dump() to write a Python object to a file in JSON format. This will convert the object into a JSON string and write it to a specified file.

Reading a JSON File:

Use json.load() to read a JSON file and convert its content into a Python object.

3. What is *args and How to Use it
*args:
*args is used in function definitions to pass a variable number of positional arguments to the function. It allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments, which are stored in a tuple.
Example:
python
Copy code
def greet(*args):
    for name in args:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
greet('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie')
# Output: Hello, Alice!
#         Hello, Bob!
#         Hello, Charlie!

4. What is **kwargs and How to Use it
**kwargs:
**kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. It is often used when you want to handle named arguments that you don't know in advance. The arguments are captured as a dictionary.
Example:
python
Copy code
def print_user_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
print_user_info(name='John', age=30, location='New York')
# Output: name: John
#         age: 30
#         location: New York

5. Handle Named Arguments in a Function
Named Arguments:
Named arguments (or keyword arguments) are specified by explicitly stating the parameter names when calling a function. This is useful for functions that have many parameters, as it improves readability and allows you to pass arguments in any order

Example:
python

def book_ticket(event, date, time, seat='General'):
    print(f"Event: {event}, Date: {date}, Time: {time}, Seat: {seat}")
book_ticket(event='Concert', date='2024-11-15', time='7:00 PM', seat='VIP')

Handling Named Arguments with Defaults:
Define default values for some arguments, so that they are optional.
Example:
python

def greet_user(name='Guest'):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
greet_user()        # Output: Hello, Guest!
greet_user('Duncan')  # Output: Hello, Duncan!
