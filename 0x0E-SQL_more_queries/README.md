# SQL - More Queries
This project focuses on advanced SQL queries and database design concepts. It builds on basic SQL knowledge, introducing topics such as user permissions, joins, subqueries, and constraints. By the end of this project, you'll have a deeper understanding of relational database management systems (RDBMS).

## Learning Objectives
- How to create a new MySQL user.
- How to manage privileges for a user to a database or table.
- What are PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY.
- How to use NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.
- How to retrieve data from multiple tables in one request.
- What are subqueries.
- What are JOIN and UNION.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MySQL 8.0 (version 8.0.25)
- Each file must end with a new line.
- SQL queries should have a comment explaining their purpose.
- All files should start with a comment describing the task.
- SQL keywords must be in uppercase (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`).
- A `README.md` file is mandatory.
- File length will be tested using `wc`.
