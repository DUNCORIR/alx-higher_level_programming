0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping
Project Overview
In this project, we explore the integration of Python with databases through Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using MySQL and SQLAlchemy. The primary objective is to learn how Python can interact with MySQL databases using both the MySQLdb library and SQLAlchemy ORM, as well as gain a deeper understanding of SQL operations and database handling.

Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for writing scripts.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Concepts of classes, objects, and methods are applied to interact with databases.
SQL: Structured Query Language for managing and manipulating databases.
MySQL: The database management system used for storing and querying data.
SQLAlchemy: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library used to interact with the MySQL database using Python classes and objects.

Setup Instructions
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0F-python-object-relational-mapping.git
cd 0x0F-python-object-relational-mapping
2. Install dependencies
You will need to install the required Python libraries to run the scripts:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Setup MySQL Database
Ensure you have MySQL running on your local machine.
Create the database hbtn_0e_0_usa and populate it with the provided SQL schema.
Update the credentials (username, password) in the scripts where necessary.
4. Run the Scripts
For each task, you can run the corresponding script with the required arguments as follows:

bash
Copy code
./0-select_states.py <mysql_username> <mysql_password> <database_name>
Make sure to replace <mysql_username>, <mysql_password>, and <database_name> with the appropriate values.

Example Output
Here is an example of what the output may look like for Task 0:

bash
Copy code
(1, 'California')
(2, 'Arizona')
(3, 'Texas')
(4, 'New York')
(5, 'Nevada')
Key Concepts Learned
MySQLdb: Connecting to MySQL databases and executing raw SQL queries in Python.
SQLAlchemy ORM: Using Python classes to interact with a relational database and query data via ORM.
SQL Injection Prevention: Protecting queries against malicious input by using parameterized queries.
Database Management: Efficiently managing and querying data stored in MySQL databases using both SQL and ORM techniques.
