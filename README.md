Why Python
Python is a versatile programming language that makes tasks easier to automate. Whether you want to:

Rename files,
Write simple games,
Or create a custom database,
Python offers simplicity and powerful tools to get the job done quickly. Unlike shell scripts, which are great for file manipulation but not ideal for GUIs or complex programs, Python covers a wide range of applications.

Simplicity: Python allows you to write shorter, cleaner code than languages like C/C++ or Java.
High-level Data Types: It has built-in data structures like flexible arrays and dictionaries.
Interactive Mode: Python is an interpreted language, which means no time-consuming compilation. You can test and experiment with your code quickly.
Modular Design: Python programs can be split into reusable modules.
Cross-Platform: Python works on Windows, macOS, and Unix.

Using Python's Interpreter
To start Python, you just type python3.12 in the terminal (or py on Windows). Python operates like a Unix shell; it can be run interactively or by executing a script.

Key Features:
Interactive Mode: When commands are typed in real-time at the prompt (>>>), Python executes them immediately. This is great for testing and experimenting.
Running Scripts: You can run Python scripts directly using python script.py.
You can also pass arguments to Python scripts, which are stored in sys.argv.
